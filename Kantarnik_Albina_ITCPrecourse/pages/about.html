      <h1> About me</h1>
      <p> Hello, world! My name is Albina Kantarnik. I live in Haifa in Israel. </p>

      <h2> My interest in coding </h2>
      <p> This is my first programming experience. I like the fact that every action I take in the code has a consequence. You can invent your own world and show it to others. Programming definitely changes the world, and I can do something new. </p>

      <h2> My educational and career experiences </h2>
      <p>All my training and work experience has been related to management in one way or another. For the past three years, I have successfully managed an IT startup developing mobile applications and websites. Having moved to Israel, I wanted to fulfill my desire to learn programming and implement more complex projects with knowledge of the matter from all sides.</p>

      <h2> My personal interests </h2>
      <p> I have been dancing for 25 years. She has always led an active lifestyle. In Israel, I started running 8-10 km, which I had never done before. Israel for me is a country of new opportunities and discoveries. ITC is one of them.</p>
